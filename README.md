# Call Center Analysis Using Power BI
# Problem Statement:
The goal of this analysis is to evaluate and improve the performance and customer satisfaction of a call center. The dataset includes the following columns: Call Id, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, Answered (Y/N), Resolved, Speed of answer in seconds, AvgTalkDuration, and Satisfaction rating. The analysis aims to identify key performance metrics, trends, and areas for improvement to enhance the overall efficiency and customer experience in the call center.

# Approach:
Data Collection and Preparation:

Import the call center data into Power BI.
Ensure data cleanliness and integrity, checking for any missing or inconsistent entries.
Format columns appropriately (e.g., converting Date and Time columns to date-time formats, ensuring numerical data is correctly typed).
Dashboard Design:

Call Volume Analysis:
Display total number of calls handled by each agent.
Analyze call volume trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
Identify peak call times.
Performance Metrics:
Measure average speed of answer and average talk duration per agent.
Compare answered vs. unanswered calls.
Evaluate the resolution rate of calls.
Customer Satisfaction:
Display average satisfaction rating per agent.
Correlate satisfaction ratings with other metrics (e.g., speed of answer, resolution rate).
Agent Performance:
Create a leaderboard of agents based on various metrics (e.g., number of resolved calls, satisfaction rating).
Identify top and bottom performers.
